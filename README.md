The video game sales database available in kaggle was used. (Database available in the archives)

We calculated the measures of centrality and dispersion, from the values ​​available in the datasets and created boxplots.

For the second part of the project we made graphs for the data analysis.

For the third part of the project we looked for where we could clean or transform dataframe columns.

For the last part we utilize k-means to answer some of our questions related to the conclusion of the project about the growth of games, and adding it to the dataset.
